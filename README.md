# Movies_Recommendation
Implement a movie recommendation system of low computation complexity via deep learning with Python and PyTorch 
Convert the data into Torch tensors, and create the architecture of the neural network with stacked autoencoder (SAE).
Train and test SAE with the “MovieLens” datasets which contain 1 million ratings from 6000 users on 4000 movies
Fulfill the prediction with small mean square error without overfitting
